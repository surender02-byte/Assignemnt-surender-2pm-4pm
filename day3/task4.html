Here are two simple benefits of using semantic tags:

1.Better readability and structure
Semantic tags like <header>, <main>, <article>, and <footer> make your HTML easier to understand for both developers and browsers.

2.Improved accessibility and SEO
Screen readers and search engines can easily recognize the meaning of each section, which helps users with disabilities and improves search ranking.
