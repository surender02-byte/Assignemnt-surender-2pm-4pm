Semantic Tags (Meaningful)

Examples:
<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, <aside>

✔ What they do

1.They describe the purpose of the content.
2.Help browsers, screen readers, and search engines understand the structure.
3.Improve SEO and accessibility.

✔ When to use semantic tags?

1.Use them when your content has meaning or a specific role, such as
2.Page header → <header>
3.Navigation menu → <nav>
4.Main page content → <main>
5.A grouped topic or category → <section>
6.A standalone blog/news post → <article>
7.Sidebar or extra info → <aside>
8.Page footer → <footer>


2. <div> (Generic Container)
✔ What it is

1.A non-semantic element → gives ZERO meaning.
2.Used only for grouping content or applying CSS.

✔ When to use <div>?

1.Use <div> when:
2.There is no specific semantic tag that fits the content.
3.You need a container for styling, layout, or JavaScript hooks.
4.Creating reusable UI blocks (cards, boxes, wrappers).

✔ Examples of good <div> usage:

1.A card box
2.A wrapper for grid/column layout
3.Grouping multiple elements just for styling
